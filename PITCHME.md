# Channels

---

## Private vs Public

Note:

Private channels can't be made public. So default to public unless really necessary.

---

## Projects vs Interests

Note:

Specific vs. cross-cutting.

---

## Channel Topics

---

## Pinning Messages

(vs Starring Messages)

Note:

Pinning messages makes them available under a shortcut for everyone who visits a channel.
Sort of an FAQ for visitors old and new.
